                        When applying to dental school what can I include to help my application stand out from the crowd?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important to demonstrate that you have taken leadership roles in extracurricular activities and that you have used all resources available to get accepted into Dental School. The Virtual Chair course specifically focuses on critical skills necessary to become a Dentist and highlights your desire to become the best candidate.

                        When is the best time to address the psychomotor skills required for dental education? </p>
                    <p>
                        The earlier you begin the better. First, you can determine whether you have, or can learn the skills required for a successful dental career. This small investment can save you hundreds of thousands of dollars should you realize dentistry is not for you. Second, the earlier you start, the more your skills will develop over time. Admission committees love to see students who demonstrate a desire for continuous improvement, not just seeking a quick box to check off.

                        Will the Virtual Preparation Center help me with my Dental School Application?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, you will be have the opportunity to progress through an e-learning and interactive video and evaluation experience that will guide you down a virtual road map from your Freshman to Senior year as an undergrad, providing exposure to all aspects of preparation for your application. Think of it as a real life syllabus that coincides and enhances your preparation and understanding of your future dental career

                    <p class="lead">
                        What happens after I pass the course? </p>
                    <p>
                        You will receive a certificate from The Virtual Chair confirming your successful completion of the psychomotor skill training. The certificate will be signed by Dr. Cooper and Dr. Callan. It is valid for one year from date of completion. You can submit the certificate as supplemental material for your dental school application. Currently, your scores are not reported to Dental Schools. Completely The Virtual Chair Course does not guarantee your acceptance into dental school.

                    <p class="lead">
                        I am not applying for at least another year, should I start now? What happens when the certificate expires? </p>
                    <p>
                        As stated above, you should begin training as soon as practical. Deliberate, repeated practice, over time will enhance your psychomotor skills to their greatest potential. These enhanced skills could easily be the differentiator for advancing in dental school or getting acceptance to a specialty.

                    </p>
                    <p>We offer re-certification at a discounted price.

                        As a busy college student, I am concerned with being able to attend on a regular basis. What options will I have? </p>
                    <p>
                        You will have 1 year to complete the program, once you begin. While you are not allowed more than 1 training session in a week (due to the psychomotor learning research outcomes), we do encourage you to try and set your training sessions so that they are one to two weeks apart.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We understand that some students will have to travel to take the course and this is challenging. However, we know how difficult the competition will be to get into Dental School and we will work with you to ensure we can support your busy schedule and travel needs. </p>

                        I have booked training courses, but have decided to not take the course now. What happens? </p>
                    <p>
                        Until you take your first class, which can be scheduled at anytime after you book, if you decide to cancel with The Virtual Chair, we will refund all of your money for the booking. However, after you have attended your first course, all fees are non-refundable. </p>
