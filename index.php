                    <p>Becoming a Dentist is challenging. Working with hand tools and mastering indirect vision is difficult. The ratio of applications to accepted students is nearly 20 to 1. On paper many applicants look very similar, based on the criteria evaluated such as academic history and DAT score. </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <p>By the time you apply for dental school you have already accumulated debt from your undergraduate degree. You will likely pay up to $3,500 to ensure you are prepared for the DAT, which is taken multiple times by most successful applicants. If you apply for dental school and you are accepted, you can expect to pay between $40,000 and $150,000 a year, depending on the school you attend.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Most dental students pay for dental school with loans. These loans are paid back when the students become dentists. Any delay in graduation increases the size of the loan balance. Students who graduate with underdeveloped hand skills face significant career challenges. Practice production is directly tied to hand skills. Those with weak skills face production challenges which impair their ability to repay these substantial loans.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For students with strong natural hand skills, psychomotor skill development before enrollment in dental school will provide an enhanced educational experience. Your skills will be developed further in school which will allow higher practice production after graduation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Do you <strong>know</strong> if you have the psychomotor skills to become a Dentist? If not, the process of preparation, application, and even acceptance to Dental School is a risky choice, considering the amount of the investment.</p>

                                "Practicing on the virtual training simulator before entering dental school significantly helped in developing precise psychomotor skills that are necessary to excel in school and the profession. It was also beneficial to be exposed to indirect vision prior to dental school as it is a difficult skill to acquire. Iâ€™m grateful to have had the opportunity to practice on the virtual training simulator before dental school and think it would be a great benefit to any pre-dental student that uses it."

When my first operative course came around, I was positioned for success because I was exposed to the virtual training simulator beforehand."
